# PREMIRE-Model Management Website Clone📸
✨Welcome to PREMIRE, my first minor project where I attempted to clone a website design sourced from Pinterest, with the guidance of Sarthak Sharma as my frontend mentor. This website is dedicated to model management and is built entirely using HTML and CSS.

# Project Highlights                  
🌟 Design Inspiration: Cloned a website design from Pinterest for a model management website.                     
🖥️ Tech Stack: Built using HTML and CSS only, showcasing fundamental frontend development skills.                                
🚀 Challenging Experience: My first complete website clone project, without access to images and videos, posed exciting challenges that I thoroughly enjoyed overcoming.
